# MacTrack

A free, native macOS menu bar app that shows where your time actually goes: which **apps** you focus on, which **websites** you spend it on, and **how productive** that time is. It can also **block** distracting apps and sites on a locked timer, and **pause overnight**. No account, no subscription, no cloud. It lives in your menu bar, stays out of the way, and keeps every byte of data on your Mac.

Most time trackers are heavy, paid, and want your data. MacTrack is the opposite: one small menu bar app, a clean read on your day, and a database that never leaves your machine.

## What it does

- **Tracks focused time, not open windows.** Time counts only for the app you are actually in front of. Background apps never inflate your totals.
- **Tracks individual websites.** When you are in a browser, MacTrack credits time to the site's domain (`youtube.com`, `github.com`), so you see web time the way you experience it. Works with Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, and Vivaldi.
- **Splits your X accounts.** Run more than one X account? MacTrack reads which one is active straight from the page and tracks each on its own row, so the account you doomscroll and the one you use for work never blur together.
- **Knows when you step away.** Tracking pauses when you go idle or lock the screen, so a coffee break never lands on whatever you left open.
- **Apps, Websites, and All.** Toggle between just apps, just sites, or one merged ranking sorted by time. In the merged view the browser app drops out so its individual sites tell the real story.
- **A clean daily line chart.** The top items plotted across your day in each app or site's own brand color, with a hover scrubber for exact values. The chart spans your **real active window** — from the first activity when you wake the Mac to your last — instead of a fixed schedule.
- **Your true total time.** The productivity overview headlines your **total active time on the Mac** for the day, measured from your first move; the home list keeps the live "what you're on right now" readout at the top instead.
- **Drill into any row.** Click an app or site to open its detail — a bar chart of when the time went (per hour across the day, or per day across the week) in its own brand color, with its share of your day, or your whole week, called out.
- **Glanceable totals.** The menu bar shows live time for whatever you are on right now. Open the popover for the full breakdown.
- **Right-click to ignore.** Don't want something tracked? Right-click any row and choose "Don't track." It disappears and stays gone.
- **A productivity score.** Tag any app or site as productive or unproductive (right-click → **Productivity**). MacTrack rolls your day into a Productive / Unproductive / Other donut so you see your focus at a glance; anything untagged counts as Other. Browsers themselves are never judged — only the sites you actually visit are, so an empty tab or a search-results page you pass through never lands in the split (it still counts toward your total time).
- **A history you can scrub.** A GitHub-style activity grid colors each past day by what dominated it — productive, unproductive, or other. Click any day to rewind the whole popover — donut, ranked list, and chart — to that day's data.
- **Block distractions.** Right-click anything and block it for 15 minutes to 2 hours. While a block is live there is no off switch — a locked countdown, plus app-hiding and tab-bouncing, keeps you out until it expires. An optional **system-level filter** (a signed Network Extension) makes it DoH-proof and keeps working even if you quit MacTrack — see [SETUP_BLOCKING.md](SETUP_BLOCKING.md).
- **Good-night mode.** One tap stops tracking for the night and auto-resumes at the wake time you set, so late-night idle never skews your day.
- **Focus Guard.** Linger too long on something you've tagged unproductive and MacTrack frosts the whole screen with a quote — a line of discipline from Stoics, conquerors, founders, and investors — set in a serif card that writes itself in word by word. It clears the moment you switch away; a quiet link to get back to work waits at the bottom and only appears once you pause and click. Pick which quote collections feed it and how long "too long" is in settings.

## Focus & productivity

Right-click any app or website and mark it **Productive** or **Unproductive**. The pie-chart toggle in the header flips the popover to a productivity overview — one donut splitting your day into Productive / Unproductive / Other, with the productive share called out in the middle. Untagged time is Other, so the picture is honest from day one.

A browser is judged only by the **sites** you visit, never as an app — so a new/empty tab, an internal page, or a search-results page (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, …) you pass through on the way somewhere is left out of the split entirely and can't inflate Other. That time still counts toward your total, so the number above the donut stays honest.

</p>

### Your history, day by day

Below the donut, a GitHub-style **activity grid** built from squircles colors each past day by the category that took the most time that day — Productive (amber), Unproductive (red), or Other (gray) — each with a soft matching glow. Today stays a neutral gray until the day is over, so it only commits to a color once the winner is final; days later in the week aren't drawn yet.

Click any day's square to **rewind the whole popover to that day**: the donut, the Productive / Unproductive / Other split, the ranked apps-and-sites list, and the line chart all animate to that day's data, and the header shows the date and total with a **Today** button to jump back.

</p>

### Drill into any app or site

Click any row to open its detail: a bar chart of exactly when the time went — minute-by-hour across the day, or totalled per day across the week — drawn in the app or site's **own brand color**, pulled live from its icon or favicon (Safari's blue, YouTube's red). The header calls out its share of your screen time: **% of today** in the day view, or **% of the whole week** in the week view.

</p>

### X accounts, tracked separately

Signed into more than one X account? MacTrack reads the **active** account straight from the page and tracks each one on its own row — so the account you doomscroll and the one you keep professional never get lumped together. Open it and a slider lets you switch between accounts or see the combined **All** total, and you can tag each account productive or unproductive on its own. Because all X accounts share one URL, this needs **"Allow JavaScript from Apple Events"** turned on in your browser's Develop menu — the one signal that reveals which account is live. (Account names blurred below.)

</p>

## Blocking

Need to lock yourself out of something? Right-click any app or site, choose **Block**, and pick 15 minutes to 2 hours. A locked countdown appears in the popover with no cancel button — while it runs, MacTrack hides the blocked app and bounces blocked tabs, and the block survives quitting and relaunching. It also resists clock tampering: moving your clock forward can't skip a running block.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/blocking.png" width="320" alt="Blocking an app for a set time" />
</p>

That app-side layer can be dodged by force-quitting MacTrack. For a bulletproof, system-wide block — a signed **Network Extension** content filter, DoH-proof and enforced by macOS itself even when MacTrack isn't running — see **[SETUP_BLOCKING.md](SETUP_BLOCKING.md)**. It needs your own Apple Developer signing, so it ships as code plus a step-by-step guide.

## Focus Guard

Blocking is the hard stop. Focus Guard is the gentle one. Switch it on, and once you've spent an unbroken stretch — the threshold is yours, from 5 minutes to an hour — on anything tagged **unproductive**, MacTrack frosts the entire screen and shows a single quote, centred, in a serif card that reveals itself one word at a time. It's a nudge, not a jail: the blur lifts on its own the instant you move to something else, and the way back to work sits quietly at the bottom of the screen, appearing only after you stop and click once.

The quotes come from collections you choose in settings — Stoic discipline (Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius), leaders and conquerors (Caesar, Napoleon, Sun Tzu), business and money, daily motivation, Naval Ravikant, and more — so the voice doing the nudging is one you actually respect. The card is set in Newsreader with the author as an italic em-dash signoff; short quotes stay on one line.

## Privacy

- **Local-first.** Your history lives in a SQLite database at `~/Library/Application Support/MacTrack/`. It is never uploaded anywhere.
- **Domains only.** MacTrack records that you were on a domain and for how long. It never saves page titles or what you were doing on a site.
- **One network call.** The only thing fetched from the internet is website favicons (cached after first use). Everything else is offline.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later
- Xcode 26 or later (to build)

## Build and run

The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` with [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
brew install xcodegen        # once
git clone https://github.com/Entrepenulian/MacTrack.git
cd MacTrack
xcodegen generate            # creates MacTrack.xcodeproj
open MacTrack.xcodeproj       # build & run with ⌘R
```

Or build from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild -project MacTrack.xcodeproj -scheme MacTrack -configuration Release build
```

Launch at login can be turned on in settings.

## Permissions

To measure per-website time, MacTrack reads the active tab's address through macOS **Automation** (Apple Events). The first time it reads a browser, macOS asks for permission. Allow it, or website time won't be recorded. You can change it later in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**, or from the gear in MacTrack.

## Settings

Open settings from the gear in the popover. It opens to a **home that groups everything into categories** — General, Good Night, Focus Guard, Chart, Website Tracking, and Blocking — and you tap one to drill into just its controls, so no screen runs off the bottom: launch at login and the idle timeout; your good-night **wake time**; the chart's start and end hours; website-tracking permission; the system-level blocking toggle; and **Focus Guard** — switch it on, set how long counts as too long, tick the quote collections to draw from, and play a Test of the blur.

</p>

## How it works

A once-a-second sampler measures the real elapsed time between ticks and credits it to whatever is in focus: the frontmost app, and the active tab's domain if that app is a browser. Large gaps (sleep, wake) are dropped, and idle or locked time is skipped. Totals roll up per day; a lightweight per-minute series powers the chart. Writes are incremental and crash-safe (SQLite WAL), with daily backups and automatic restore.

## Tech

Swift, SwiftUI, and AppKit. SQLite via the system library (no third-party dependencies). `MenuBarExtra` for the menu bar surface, Apple Events for browser URLs, and `SMAppService` for launch at login. Focus Guard's blur is a non-activating `NSPanel` at `CGShieldingWindowLevel()` with a native `NSVisualEffectView`, so it covers the menu bar and fullscreen apps without stealing focus.
